          The city of Cologne can look back on a very long history. In 50 AD,
          the Roman Empress Agrippina (wife of Claudius
          <a

          This is where the ancient name of the city comes from, which was then
          called Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium.

          Shortly afterwards, in the year 69, Aulus Vitellius was proclaimed
          emperor by the local Roman-German legions.<br />As early as 80 AD, the
          city received one of the longest Roman aqueducts, the Eifel aqueduct.
          From 90 AD, Cologne became a Roman provincial capital.<br /><br />

          <br />
          <h5>
            In the Middle Ages, Cologne was known as a European trading
            metropolis, art metropolis, metropolis of the ecclesiastical
            province of Cologne and archbishop's seat, free imperial city and
            pilgrimage city.<br /><br />Probably from the 2nd century on a
            Christian community existed in Cologne , and the town is first
            mentioned as a bishopric in 313 AD.<br />
            Charlemagne made it an archbishopric in the late 8th century.<br />
            More and more the city was dominated by the the archbishop and in
            the 10th century a wide range of tolls, customs duties, and other
            payments had to be made to him. There were increasingly conflicts
            between the wealthy merchants who fought for commercial and
            political freedom and the archbishop. From the 13th century the
            archbishop became one of the electors privileged to choose the
            German king. It was not until the Battle of Worringen, in 1288, that
            the archbishop was finally defeated, and the city of Cologne secured
            full self-government.<br />
            <br />Now the city turned into a free imperial city, although it was
            only officially recognized as such in 1475.<br /><br />The wealthy
            patricians ruled the city until the end of the 14th century. In 1396
            a revolution occurred which changed the city constitution.<br />
            Now the 22 guilds formed the government by electing a council which
            then exercised power.<br />

          <h4>
            In the Middle Ages there were various city names, such as Coellen or
            Coelln (on the Rhine) or in Latin mostly Colonia Agrippina (or
            Agrippina Nobilis Romanorum Colonia). <br />For a long time Cologne
            was the largest city north of the Alps in terms of area and
            population and until the end of the late Middle Ages it was the city
            with the most inhabitants in the Roman-German Empire.<br />
            Constantine the Great built a castle and a permanent bridge to it
            across the Rhine in 310 AD.<br />
            Ceramics and glass were manufactured.<br /><a

            ><br />Cologne was conquered by the Franks around 456 AD,<br />
            and became the residence of the kings of the Ripuarian part of the
            Frankish kingdom.<br />Cologne really flourished in the Middle Ages.
            It developed into an important part of the Hanseatic League, with
            Cologne merchants said to have the most extensive contacts and the
            most diverse trades of all cities in Germany.Enamelling and
            metalworking, textile manufacturing, book manufacturing and leather
            processing were all represented in the city. Art and religion were
            very important.

          <h4>
            The greatest Roman Catholic scholars and theologians of medieval
            scholasticism, such as Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas and John Duns
            Scotus, taught at Cologne schools. <br />The city's population
            increased massively. While around 25,000 people lived in the city in
            1180, by 1600 there were already 40,000. Cologne was thus as big as
            Prague and was one of the largest cities in the empire.<br />The
            history of the city has been archived since 1130. Cologne had the
            first town hall and the first civic university in 1388.<br /><br />The
            Old Cologne painting, the renowned medieval Cologne school of
            painting, occupied a leading position in the Middle Ages. The
            painters worked mainly in Schildergasse, where the sign painters
            were also based, i.e. in the street that developed from the Roman
            Decumanus Maximus and is today one of the most frequented shopping
            streets in Germany. The most famous painters of the Old Cologne
            painting were Stefan Lochner, the Master of Saint Veronica and
            Bartholomäus Bruyn.<br />In the Middle Ages, Cologne was one of the
            three most important pilgrimage cities, along with Rome and Santiago
            de Compostela in northern Spain, with up to 500,000 pilgrims per
            year. <br />In 1164, the bones of the Three Holy Kings were
            transferred to Cologne.<br />In 1121 the relics of Saint Gereon were
            found; he, like Saint Ursula <br />(whose bones were found in the
            12th century), are immortalized in the city's coat of arms.
            <br />
            In today's cathedral treasury there are countless other relics of
            saints such as St. Severin and others, as well as St. Peter's staff
            and parts of St. Peter's chain.

            But Cologne also had difficult times in the Middle Ages. The city
            experienced a decline after the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), which
            in particular led to the collapse of the Hanseatic League. In 1794,
            the city was occupied by the French who stayed till 1814. This is
            why the Middle Ages lasted longer in Cologne than in other German
            cities. The arrival of the French in 1794 can be seen as the
            decisive turning point. The Jewish community, which had existed
            since the time of Constantine the Great, was expelled in 1424 and
            until 1794, Jews were even forbidden to spend the night in the
            city.<br />While Cologne was called the "most beautiful city in
            Germany" during its heyday, by the 18th century many visitors had
            only considered it a "hideous city".<br /><br />

            flourished in the city. The first chamber of commerce in Germany was
            opened. The construction of the railway meant that Cologne also
            became a railway hub due to its geographical location.

            In the 1970s, a terrible incident occurred in the Cologne district
            of Braunsfeld. On September 5, 1977, the "Siegfried Hausner
            Commando" of the RAF (Red Army Faction, a former left-wing extremist
            terrorist organization from Germany) kidnapped the employers'
            president Hanns Martin Schleyer from his vehicle on
            Vincenz-Statz-Straße and murdered his four companions. Schleyer's
            body was found on October 19, 1977 in the trunk of an Audi parked on
            Rue Charles Peguy in Mulhouse (Alsace).
